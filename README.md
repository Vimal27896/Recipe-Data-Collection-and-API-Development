# Recipe-Data-Collection-and-API-Development

This project is a Spring Boot–based REST API designed to process a large JSON dataset of recipes, transform and clean the data, store it in a relational database, and expose a complete RESTful API for managing recipe records.

The application performs three core functions:

JSON parsing and transformation

Database data ingestion

REST API implementation for recipe management

The system ensures data validation, structured storage, and clean API responses for both successful and error scenarios.
